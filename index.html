            <h4>Relation between Instagram tags of @Ynote_hk</h4>
            <p>In order to see the dynamics between <a href="https://instagram.com/Ynote_hk/" target="_blank">@Ynote_hk</a> pictures on Instagram, we display these pictures tags relation mapping. As we can see, tags are used by distinct groups, probably defined by a location or a type of picture.</p>
            <div id="viz"></div>
            <h4>Json output</h4>
            <p>A <a href="https://github.com/Ynote/d3-instagram-force-layout" target="_blank">small script</a> in Node.js enables us to fetch Instagram API data from <a href="https://instagram.com/Ynote_hk/" target="_blank">@Ynote_hk</a> account and creates a json file. This latter is used with d3.js to display a force-directed graph.</p>
            <p>This example uses a static response from Instagram API. On the next step, we should add an Instragram connect and display the graph dynamically.</p>
            <p>
                For more information:
